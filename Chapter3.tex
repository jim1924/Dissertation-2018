\chapter{Requirements and Analysis}
\label{chapterlabel3}


This Chapter establishes the requirements and analysis for this work. The developments of the requirements is a crucial part of the analysis for almost all of the software development projects.

This phase is extremely useful, as for it's flexibility - if things that are unnecessarily complicated are discovered, or are less important to the client, they can be disregarded  or their importance could be downgraded so that they take less time. This is significantly useful for the implementation phase. This is also the easiest time to communicate with the client, while the subject matter is strictly textual, so any major issues or changes to the specifications can be established here.


\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sub:problem_st}

Design a web based application, that allows surgeons to register an operation, upload and view all the extracted data coming from the operating theatre's sensors.


\section{Software Requirement Listing and Prioritization}
\label{sec:softreqlistandprior} 

This stage facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the client's needs and to appreciate the potential complexity of the system. Subsection \ref{sub:functional_req} details the functional requirements of our system.  Functional requirements show the behaviours of the system - what the client wants the system to do.  Subsection \ref{sub:non_functional_req} goes through the non-functional requirements, which affect the system's performance. 
The requirements were gathered through discussion with the client and also by continually iterating over what the application would be used for, so that additional focus should be given on the user needs.


 As mentioned, the requirements have been categorised into functional and non-functional. They have also been prioritised according to the MoSCoW prioritisation technique\cite{cleggbarker1994}, in order to guide the progress of the project and to ensure that a base-level application that achieved the goals of the project. The MoSCoW priorities refer to the order of design and development in order.

\section{Domain Modelling}
The domain model looks to identify the objects of a system in terms of the requirements. It provides a conceptual real-world view of the system and enables a simplistic overview of the system's functionalities in terms of the problem domain entities \cite{DomainModeling}.
More specifically, the classes were derived from the requirements list where the identified entities were marked in bold. Therefore, it is now possible to create a simple draft domain model from these entities. Furthermore, objects which were deemed redundant from this iteration were also
discarded to refine the list of entities. This initial model was then revised and additional domain objects were
added. Similar to previous analyses, the domain model is therefore the result of an iterative process.

Following the refinement process, using the identified entities of the requirements list, the domain model was revised in order to find any unspotted domain entities that weren't already in the requirements list. 
Figure \ref{domain_model} shows the model that resulted after the various iterations. It is a summary of the responsibilities of the system on a general level and was the basis for constructing the use cases in subsection \ref{sub:use_case_analysis}.

\section{Use Case Analysis}
\label{sub:use_case_analysis}

Following the domain modelling and the gathering of requirements analysed in subsections \ref{domain_model}, \ref{functionalreq} and \ref{nonfunctionalreq} respectively, use cases were developed. The defined domain entities and requirements were used to construct the use cases and their basic relationships. The construction of the uses cases allows the solid organisation of the functional requirements of the project, in order to make sure that they meet the front-end requirements and also to make sure that they are fully encompassing. The use cases describe all of the actions that are relevant to the recognised users \citep{usecases}. Those use cases were updated several times, refined and modified, for example, by merging them together or splitting them up if they include too many or too few actions.

A complete overview of the identified use cases is shown in  Table \textcolor{yellow}{BLABLABLA} and from Table \textcolor{yellow}{BLABLABLA} to Table \textcolor{yellow}{BLABLABLA}, all the detailed specification for each use case are shown. Each specification includes details of each use case,the main flows, error flows, post-conditions, pre-conditions and the trigger event.



\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{sub:use_case_diagram}


The use case diagram which is depicted in Figure \textcolor{yellow}{BLABLABLA} is derived from the use case Listing which is basic foundation for the creation of the use case diagram.
