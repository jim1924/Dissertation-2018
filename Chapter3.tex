\chapter{Analysis of Requirements}
\label{chapterlabel3}


This Chapter establishes the requirements for this work. The developments of the requirements is a crucial part of the analysis for almost all of the software development projects.

This phase is extremely useful, as for it's flexibility - if things that are unnecessarily complicated are discovered, or are less important to the client, they can be disregarded  or their importance could be downgraded so that they take less time. This is significantly useful for the implementation phase. This is also the easiest time to communicate with the client, while the subject matter is strictly textual, so any major issues or changes to the specifications can be established here.



\section{Software Requirement Listing and Prioritization}
\label{sec:softreqlistandprior} 

This stage facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the client's needs and to appreciate the potential complexity of the system. Subsection \ref{sub:functional_req} details the functional requirements of our system.  Functional requirements show the behaviours of the system - what the client wants the system to do.  Subsection \ref{sub:non_functional_req} goes through the non-functional requirements, which affect the system's performance. 
The requirements were gathered through discussion with the client and also by continually iterating over what the application would be used for, so that additional focus should be given on the user needs.


 As mentioned, the requirements have been categorised into functional and non-functional. In subsection \ref{sub:moscow}, they have also been prioritised according to the MoSCoW prioritisation technique \cite{cleggbarker1994}.
